## NORMALLIGHT

In this game, you must navigate within a large boundary box while avoiding contact with the ors flying around you! The game continues until you strike the boundary or an orb.

To move:

 - Press space to accelerate forwards.
 - Press the left, right, up and down keys to steer in that direction.
 - Decelaration happens automatically over time
 - To exit, press escape
 - If you lose and want to play again, press primary enter (not keypad enter)

To compile and play:
 - Ensure you have g++ and libsdl2-dev installed
 - Download the source code
 - Navigate to the root folder and run ```make fullstack```
